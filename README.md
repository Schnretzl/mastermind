# mastermind
Play a game of mastermind, either as the guesser, or code setter.

Up to 12 guesses are allowed to guess the secret code.  The user can choose whether to be the guesser or the code setter.  Colors are red, blue, yellow, orange, green, and purple.  Guesses are made by entering a 4 character string consisting of the first letter of each color(e.g., bgyp for blue, green, yellow, purple).  Feedback for each guess will be up to 4 pegs of 2 different colors: black and white, where black indicates a color in the correct place, and white indicates a correct color in the incorrect place.
